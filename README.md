# SAYAN_GHOSH_PROFESSIONAL_RESUME

Hi, I am Sayan. Currently a Pre-Final year Computer Science and Engineering student at Vellore Institute of Technology, Bhopal, with a fervent passion for backend development and the transformative potential of decentralized technology. I am on a dedicated quest to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical, scalable application development.

My core interests lie in Blockchain development, Web3 infrastructure, and building robust backend systems using Microservices architecture, Spring Boot, and the MERN stack. I am an avid Competitive Programmer who thrives on solving complex problems, sharpening my skills in Data Structures and Algorithms using C++ and Java.

I am actively seeking internship opportunities where I can contribute to innovative projects, deepen my expertise in backend and blockchain systems, and collaborate with teams that are building the future of the web.
